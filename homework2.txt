Problem 1 Analysis:
Charge - Majority of neighbors allude to the sense of an indictment in court, with 
some neighbors being related to paying money. Interestingly, no neighbors are related
to the sense of charging an electronic device.
Load - All neighbors are related to the sense of being heavy or carrying said heavy
object.
Show - Clustered extremely closely to a few neighbors related to the sense of a TV
show, next closest neighbors are further away and related to the action of demonstration.


Problem 2A Results:
Correlation for animals/size: 0.657
Correlation for clothing/wealth: 0.564

Problem 2B Results:
Correlation for animals/size: 0.612
Correlation for clothing/wealth: 0.200


Problem 3A Analysis:
The clustering seems to be by sense of the word, with neighboring points being passages
with the word "charge" used in similar contexts. Most passages follow this clustering
pattern, but there is overlap, like two passages using "charge" as a legal term and
as a financial term respectively being placed within the same cluster.

Problem 3B Analysis:
These clusters seem similar to the clusters in 3A, with neighboring passages possessing
the same sense of the word "charge". Looking at the masked substitutes, they also
seem similar for passages within the same cluster.
